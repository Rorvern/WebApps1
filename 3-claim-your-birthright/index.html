    <h2 id="alone">A guide for beginners</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Getting Cards</h3>
      <p> The most important thing, obviously, is to get some cards. Cards are held at major stores like Target and card shops. Cards come from four options: booster packs, intro packs, clash packs, fat packs, and booster boxes. Each contain a certain amount of cards, which are all useful in making you deck. </p>
      <h4>Booster Packs</h4>
      <p> Booster packs contain 10 commons (rarities will be explained later), 3 uncommons, 1 rare or mythic rare, a token and/or a land, and sometimes a foil. Some sets can add cards specific to that set, such as flip cards in the Eldritch Moon set. </p>
      <h4>Intro Packs</h4>
      <p> Intro packs contain a 60-card deck, 2 booster packs, and an instruction card. These are very useful for beginners, but don't have many good cards in them.</p>
      <h4>Clash Packs</h4>
      <p>Clash packs contain two 60 card decks so you can play with a friend who doesn't have a deck. Also, there is a guide to merging the two decks to make one, better deck.</p>
      <h4>Fat Packs</h4>
      <p>Fat packs are likely the best to get for a beginner because they have nine booster packs, 80 basic lands, two deck boxes, a set manual, and a life counter. </p>
      <h4>Booster Boxes</h4>
      <p>A booster box is the best way to get cards for one reason and one reason only: it contains 36 booster packs, which is the equivalent of 540 cards or nine decks.</p>

      <h3>The Deck</h3>
      <p>Decks are made up of 60 cards. Any more or any less is considered cheating because if one player has more or less than the other, it is unfair for two reasons, the first being that the one with a larger deck has more cards to use when playing. The second reason is that when a player has no more cards to draw, they lose the game. In your deck you want a balance of lands and spells, which will be explained soon. When choosing colors for your deck (colors to be explained next), find colors that you like or that go well together. You also want to find cards that play off of each other's abilities. If you have played Yugi-Oh, another card game you already look for combos, and you have to look for the same thing in Magic.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>The Basics</h3>
      <p>The most important cards in magic are lands. These are the source of playing all your other cards. Tapping land (turning it to the side) adds mana to your mana pool, which you use to cast spells. The mana cost of a spell is in the top right corner of a card. The mana cost will also determine the color of the card. There are five colors to magic: white, blue, black, red, and green. White tends to be a lot of small creatures that will swarm your opponent, but there is the occasional big creature that is amazing. Blue is mostly spells and creatures based off of spells. Black consists of kill spells, resurrection spells, resurrection creatures, and other things that come with death. Red is a lot of damage spells and creatures that do mass damage. Green is mainly big creatures or smaller creatures that aid said big creatures. However, while all of these are what the colors mostly are, not every card adheres to these guidelines. </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Rarities</h3>
      <p>There are four rarities in magic the gathering: common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare. The rarities don't do much, but individual cards of higher rarities are likely to be more expensive and better than the lower rarities. For example, an uncommon would be better than a common but slightly expensive, but if that uncommon were less mana it would be a rare instead. If the rare version of the uncommon were improved upon in some way, it might become a mythic rare. This is the evolution of rarities.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Taking a turn</h3>
      <p>There are 4 different major phases of a turn: setup phases, main phases, attack phases, and end phases.</p>
      <h4>Setup phases</h4>
      <p>The setup phases are untap, upkeep, and draw. The order is important because your opponent can call you out and then that phase is nullified. During the untap phase you untap your cards, in upkeep some card in play have abilities that trigger and opponents can cast spells, and in the draw step you draw one card from your deck. The player who goes first does not draw a card on their first turn, but the player after does. </p>
      <h4>Main Phases</h4>
      <p>There are two main phases: one before and one after combat. During the main phases, you can play any card type. However, during each turn you can only play one land. </p>
      <h4>Attack Phases</h4>
      The attack phases are declare attackers, declare blockers and damage. These steps are pretty self explanatory, but I will explain anyways. In the declare attackers phase the attacking player chooses which creatures will attack. It is important to know that you can't attack specific creatures. Next is declare blockers, in which the defending player chooses which creatures they have will block which attacking creatures. The defender doesn't have to use all their creatures to block and may decide to let some damage go through. Then is the combat phase: In this phase creatures deal damage to each other. When two creatures fight, they deal damage equal to their power to the opposing creature's toughness, reducing the toughness. Sometimes the creatures will not die, but either player can use spells that deal damage to finish them off. When a spell does damage, it does the same thing as a creature: it reduces the toughness. Following the attack phases is your second main phase. </p>
      <h4>End Phases</h4>
      <p>There are four end phases: ability triggers, discard, heal, and the final end. In the first phase, any abilities that say “at the beginning of the end step” trigger and players may cast instants. In the discard phase, if the player has more than seven cards, they discard down to seven. During the heal phase all creatures that have damage dealt to them that have not gone to the graveyard heal all damage. In the final end phase all mana left in your mana dissipates and your turn ends. </p>

      <h3>Card Types</h3>
      <p>There are seven major types of cards in MTG: Land, creatures, instants, sorceries, enchantments, artifacts, and planeswalkers.</p>
      <h4>Creatures</h4>
      <p>Creatures normally do most of the damage to an opponent. Creatures can have an array of abilities, such as flying and indestructible. These abilities do different things, and the card usually explains the ability. In the bottom right of a card it will show the creature's power and toughness, in that order. Power is how much damage that creature can give, while toughness is how much the creature can take. When a creature's toughness goes to zero (reference phases for combat) that creature dies, and you put it in the graveyard.</p>
      <h4>Instants and Sorceriesx</h4>
      <p>The main difference between instants and sorceries is when they can be played. Both have various uses to counter opponents spells, deal damage, or affect your creatures. These spells go instantly to your graveyard. Instants can be played during almost all of the phases of a turn, as well as on an opponents turn. As previously stated, this card type does damage, destroys creatures, and can also do so much more. Like instants, sorceries have various uses, but are slightly different because sorceries can only be played on you turn, and on less of the different phases than instants. However, sorceries abilities are tailored to when they can be played.</p>
      <h4>Enchantments and Artifacts</h4>
      <p>Enchantments, like sorceries, can only be played on your turn. However, unlike instants and sorceries, enchantments stay on the battlefield. Also like instants and sorceries enchantments have a wide array of uses. Artifacts are like enchantments in that they are played on your turn, stay on the battlefield, and have various uses. However, while enchantments are colored, artifacts are always colorless. However, they can sometimes have abilities that use colored mana. Both artifacts and enchantments can come in the form of creatures, which would be called artifact or enchantment creatures. </p>
      <h4>Auras and Equipments.</h4>
      <p>Artifacts and enchantments can also be equipped to creatures, but here card types differ immensely. Enchantments that are played on creatures come in the form of auras, which are directly cast onto a creature and go to the graveyard with the creature it is attached to. Artifacts, however, that attach to creatures are called equipments. These are not directly cast onto a creature when played, but instead you must pay an equip cost to attach it. Also unlike auras equipment does not go to the graveyard with the creature, but stays on the battlefield until specifically destroyed. </p>
      <h4>Planeswalkers</h4>
      <p>Planeswalkers are arguably the most powerful card type in Magic. A planeswalker is formatted differently from any other card: Below the image, where the text would be, is a box with three, sometimes four, layers. In each is an ability that would either increase or decrease the loyalty counter. A planeswalker's starting loyalty is displayed in the bottom right corner, where the power and toughness would show if it were a creature. It is important to know that you cannot use an ability of a planeswalker if it would put the loyalty counter below zero. It can go down to zero, but never below. Planeswalkers cannot defend themselves, so when they are attacked by creatures the planeswalker itself can do nothing, so it is defended by regular creatures. When a planeswalker is dealt damage it loses loyalty counters, and when the loyalty is equal to zero, it goes to the graveyard.</p>
